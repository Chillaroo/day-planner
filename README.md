The "Work Day Scheduler" is a simple calendar app for scheduling your work day. When you load the app, you'll see today's date and time, and a series of one-hour timeslots from 6am to 10pm. The color coding is gray for hours that have past, red for the current hour, and green for hours yet to come. Click into any timeslot to input an activity. When you're done scheduling your day, click on the blue "Save" button at the bottom, and your schedule will be saved even after refreshing the page. You can add, delete, or modify any events - just click "Save" again when you're done. If you would like to permanently delete all of the events, press the red "Clear" button.
